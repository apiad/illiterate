# To represent the different types of content in a single Python file,
# we will use three classes.
# These classes will represent, respectively, a block of [Markdown](ref:illiterate.core:Markdown) text,
# a block of [Python](ref:illiterate.core:Python) code, and a top-level [docstring](ref:illiterate.core:Docstring).

# The only difference between these types of content that we care of
# is how they are printed as Markdown.
# Other than that, all types of content are simply a list of text lines.

# There is however one common functionality for all of them.
# Depending on how the file is structured, we might end up with
# spurious empty lines at the begining or end of any block.
# This might not be a big issue for Markdown, in some cases, but it is
# definitely a problem for Python code.
# Hence, we will remove all the empty lines at the begining and the end
# of each block.

# The common functionality will go into an abstract class.

# The only relevant functionality in this class is cleaning up
# the list of content.
# We also define an abstract method `print` which inheritors
# will override to determine how different types of content are printed.

# Markdown blocks are either formed by lines starting with `#`
# (i.e., Python comments) or blank lines.
# For every line that starts with `#_`, we simply remove the first two
# characters, i.e., the sharp symbol and the starting space.
# For blank lines, we just output them as-is.

# The only slightly complex functionality in Markdown blocks is formatting
# references. We want to write something `ref:illiterate.core:Markdown`
# in our documentation, and have it translated automatically to
# `../illiterate.core#ref:Markdown`.

# Python blocks are even easier, since we will print them as-is.
# There are two points to keep in mind.
# First is, we need to output a Markdown fenced code block
# before and after the actual code.
# Second, we are going to collect all class and method definitions that appear
# in this block and output some invisible HTML anchors.
# These anchors won't render in the Markdown or the table of content but you
# can use them to link to method.
# For example, see the [`Parser`](#class:Parser) class defined below.

    #     To extend this to second-level definitions and beyond, we're gonna have to introduce some
    #     sort of stack to keep track of the outer definitions, because a class name can be defined
    #     in a different Python block than its inner methods.

# ## The Parser

# Finally, we have come to the core functionality of `illiterate`, the class
# that reads Python source code and produces the corresponding blocks.
# The parser is then a very simple automaton with three states.

# Since we don't really care about the structure of the code, this parser
# is very simple. Formally, we are dealing with a regular language, since
# we can determine what type of content we are dealing with based solely on the
# first character.

    # The automaton switches states according to the first character of the current line.
    # Intuitively, as long as we are seeing either a `#` or blank lines, we are
    # seeing Markdown. Once we see a line that doesn't begin with a `#`, that
    # must be code or docstring.

    # If `inline == True`, which is activated with `--inline` in the CLI, we will
    # parse any comments that appear on a line by itself, such as these ones, as
    # Markdown.
    # Otherwise, only comments that appear exactly at the beginning of the line
    # will be considered Markdown, and the rest will be parsed as code.

    # Doctrings always start with """. Once inside a docstring, until a line doesn't end
    # with """, we assume everything is part of the string.
